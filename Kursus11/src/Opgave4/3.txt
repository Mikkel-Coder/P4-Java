If your communication only allows, say 100 train descriptions to be send back in a single
response, an error could also be that too many trains were found. How can you address
this?

when the client tries to delete a train from the train list, there might perhaps not be any trains left.
Instead of printing the stracktrace we should throw a coustome excetion like NoTrainsRemainingException

see client.java line 312 in X_TrainCLI.java in Opgave1 package
